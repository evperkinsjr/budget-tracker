# Budget Tracker
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description
For this project, I added functionality to a Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. It gives users a fast, easy way to track their money and allows them to access that information anytime.

The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.


## Links
The application was deployed using MongoDB Atlas and Heroku.
